# About

This is a fork of the excellent pasaffe project from https://launchpad.net/pasaffe

Refer to this site for latest updates in case this here gets out-of-date.

Since I was not interested in bzr, I cloned to bzr repo, converted it to git and pushed it here on github.

# Changes

* limited results returned by the "find" button:
  It now properly finds any record that matches the pattern in the title, username, url, password, notes, folder, etc.
  The "find" now works to my liking but is unlikely to be clean enough to be submitted as is upstream as a PR.

# How

Install the official pasaffe package to get any missing dependencies.
Clone the project, run pasaffe from the ./bin/ folder and enjoy.
